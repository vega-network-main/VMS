# VMS

### VMS - VEGA Minecraft Server core implementation

This server core is based on [Minestom-CE](https://github.com/hollow-cube/minestom-ce) (ver: 1.20.1)

We are trying to create a similiar to vanilla server implemantation as well as allow more extendability for the end-user in writing extensions or etc

We would appreciate PR and help as well, since it's community based project.

TO-DO:
- Reimplement all vanilla mechanics
- Add plugin support (aka Extensions. Maybe even JSON ones)
- Add more features, make multithreaded
